üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Java 17+

Spring Boot 3.x

Spring Data JPA

Hibernate

RESTful APIs

PostgreSQL (or H2 for local development)

Maven

Lombok

üèÅ Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher

Maven

(Optional) PostgreSQL database instance, or it will default to H2 in-memory database.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/online-quiz-app-backend.git
cd online-quiz-app-backend

(Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username and online-quiz-app-backend with your repository name)

Configure Database (Optional - for PostgreSQL):
If you're using PostgreSQL, update your src/main/resources/application.properties (or application.yml) with your database credentials:

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_database_name
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update # or create
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect

If you don't configure PostgreSQL, Spring Boot will use an in-memory H2 database by default.

Build the project:

mvn clean install

Run the application:

mvn spring-boot:run

The application will start on http://localhost:8080 by default.
